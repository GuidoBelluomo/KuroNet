# KuroNet
A garry's mod module that allows to send virtually infinitely long strings. Functions for sending tables included, but they require pON. Feel free to modify this to use something else like JSON.

Examples can be found at the beginning of the lua script.

This uses a queue system to make sure messages arrive in order, in case it may happen they don't.
