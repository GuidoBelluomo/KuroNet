# KuroNet
A garry's mod module that allows to send virtually infinitely long strings. Functions for sending tables included, defaulted to use the JSON functions that comes with GMod. It's very easy to change this, and it's pretty straightforward.

Examples can be found at the beginning of the lua script.

This uses a queue system to make sure messages arrive in order, in case it may for some reason happen they don't.
